      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <img src="assets/images/profile.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Zoli Saunt">
      <p>I'm a high school dropout with an M.S. in mathematics and 6 years experience teaching at the college level.  While I love teaching and its a very rewarding job, its hasn't been personally challenging in the way I want it to be.  I love music (my first passion in life), snowboarding, backpacking (mostly in the mountains) and just about anything having to do with the outdoors.  Most of all though, I love solving problems.  I love to learn and I love a challenge.  Before I finished my degree, I was (among other things) a musician, a journeyman ironworker and a commercial salmon fisherman in Alaska.  I think coding is one of the few fields that practically guarantees that I can be a student as long as I want to be.</p>
